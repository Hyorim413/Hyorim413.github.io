				<h3>Author - Hyorim</h3>
					<p>I am a beginner-intermediate 3D modeler. I first got into the world of dimensional creation in early 2018, and since then I have been using Blender as my primary tool for modeling. I find the technology very interesting that it has power to create images that look like it was taken in real-life. As <a href="generic0.html">gallery</a> page shows, even though 3dx Max and Blender doesn't have a huge difference in its capabilities, my modelings with Blender looks simpler and less realistics than the professionals' renders in 3ds Max. However, I am very motivated and have a strong trust that I can be like the professionals in the future.</p>
