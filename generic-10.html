					<p>Tools can matter. While there are dozens of softwares specifically designed for 3D modeling, it is always good to know and use the best ones. Here in this page I show you the most used softwares, and it will vary in the level of difficulties. Examples of all the softwares can be seen in the <a href="generic0.html">gallery</a>.</p>
					<h4>Blender</h4>
					<img src="/Users/bcb-student001180/Downloads/blenderrrr.jpg" alt="" width="50%">
					<p>The king of the castle among free 3D modeling software is, without a doubt, Blender. It’s been around since 2002 and is quite polished. Running on every major operating system, it provides all the tools you expect in modeling software, including rigging, texturing, sculpting, UVing, and animation. With a solid rendering engine, it has proven itself time and again when compared to the fancier programs out there. <br> As an added bonus, it’s open-source! This means that there are constant improvements and available add-ons for new functionality are not only common, but always free of charge. This puts a lot of power in your hands. If you can’t swing an expensive license for Maya, this is the next best thing.</p>
					<h4>3ds Max</h4>

					<p>3Ds Max has been around for a long time, as far as modeling software goes. It predates almost every other current program by several years and has plenty of performance patches under its belt as a result. It’s one of the most stable 3D modeling programs around (probably the most stable option on Windows, period) and has a gigantic library available that provides access to countless functions that can make the process of modelling less tedious. Many of these mods also make things easier for beginners.</p>
					<h4>Autodesk maya</h4>
					<img src="/Users/bcb-student001180/Downloads/maya.webp" alt="" width="50%">
					<p>When you ask any professional 3D modeller in the industry which program they use the most, Autodesk Maya is the most common answer, and for good reason. Most of the leading animation studios use it (Pixar included) due in part to the massive array of powerful tools offered within the package. The last few years have seen some especially amazing new features burst into the limelight such as truly jaw-dropping live rendering.</p>
					<br>However, just be warned that Maya is a bit pricy, coming in at $245/month.
					<h4>BlocksCAD</h4>
					<img src="/Users/bcb-student001180/Downloads/blockscad.jpg" alt="" width="50%">
					<p>While all of the softwares mentioned above are aimed at professionals, or users who at least know and understand the 3d modelling mechanisms, BlocksCAD is a free software for beginners. It has a very similar workplace layout with a programming language Scratch, and it is easy to learn without any complex features. The cons therefore can be the lack of detail and creativity, but the tool is great for any beginning modelers.</p>
